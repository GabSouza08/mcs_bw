# mcs_bw
An mc plugin collection and mc server tutorial.
It is also an way to myself to understand the inner workings of this.
This is based on the server i currently run, so i might be missing some actually good plugins.

And no more talking, lets go!

## 1 - Quick server types introduction

While there are both bedrock and Java servers, i will be focusing on java servers, as there is more things to play around.
And in case you where wondering, the mcs_bw stands for MineCraftServer BlackWing. First of all, you need a name for your server.
After choosing a name, you will need to choose what server type (as in which software) you will use. There is a lot of options, but it can be reduced to these:

Vanilla: Basically what it says. An unaltered, base server that has no support for mods/plugins and proxies.
Paper/Purpur: An server type that allows for the usage of plugins (which only need to be downloaded server-side) and have support for lots of versions and plugins (Bukkit/Spigot/Paper).
Neoforge/QuiltMC: An server type that allows usage of mods (which both servers and players need to have) and mods depende on your specific server (Neoforge and Forge, Fabric and QuiltMC)
Arclight/SpongeForge: Hybrid server types that try to have both plugins and mods (i did not test this yet, but it seems to be more prone to bugs than the options above)

## 2 - Some plugins and what they do

There is quite an handful of plugins, but for now, i will be only focusing on those i already tested:

GeyserMC: An plugin to add crossplay beetween Java and Bedrock.

ViaVersion/ViaRewind: Adds support to clients in other versions to enter the server (Java only).

Multiverse-Core/Inventory: Adds traveling beetween worlds, both imported or generated.

LuckPerms: To manage permissions and players.

MarriageMaster: An marriage system with shareable inventories and some other things.

LevelledMobs: Adds levels and hp for mobs based on your level.

MedievalFactions: An simple faction system with lieges/vassals and diplomacy.
